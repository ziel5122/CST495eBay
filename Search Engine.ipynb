    "Earlier I hypothesized that I could change the weight of the title to make it more effective; I know plan to implement that by making the total weight of the title equal to the total wieght of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "My justification for this is that the title should represent the information presented in the corpus, therefore, I think it's information contribution should be weighed the same as the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of a product on a website, if the item is an iPhone 6 than iPhone and 6 will be very heavily weighted, which is basically what you want. An item with a long description full of spam will have to divide that weight among more tokens, and it probably will also have a weak description, meaning the title will have low weight and low relevancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm going to make a separate idx for the titles and a separate IDF. First I'll separate titles from corpus using code I engineered for my printing function. Unfortunately I couldn't get it to work for all documents, but I might still be able to demonstrate the concept on a smaller corpus. WARNING: MAY TAKE A WHILE"
